I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is "F”?Are you so mentally handicapped that the only letter you can comprehend is "F” - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, I\'ll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proof-read by several professors of literature. Don\'t believe me? I doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be "F” once again. Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about a single letter? I bet you took the time to type that one letter too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing "send". You\'re so fucking pathetic. I\'m honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I\'m simply far too nice to do something like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? Absolutely nothing. I couldn\'t be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a response. Do you want "F” on your gravestone? Do you want people to remember you as the asshat who one day decided to respond to someone with a single letter? "Hey, look, everybody! It\'s that "f” guy!" That\'s who you are. You\'re going to be known as the "F” guy. How does it feel? Do you feel happy? Quite honestly, I don\'t care, which is why I\'m not even going to respond to you.');

This is strange, considering that violence didn\'t exist before Call of Duty. It is theorized that violent video games existed in that period, as it would be impossible for any type of violence to happen if they were not. In late 2012, a paleontologist who was digging into a random patch of land, found a strange rock case, when it was cracked open, a disc titled "Call of Duty: Before Christ" was inside, but the disc wasn\'t able to be read, despite being tested in various disc readers. We can however speculate, that this is what led to violence in our world, starting with the "Sumer vs. Elam" war, and continuing, with war looming over us to this day.');

The act of intentionally or accidentally bringing pain upon the male genitals is typically a thought that people wince at with great force. However, there is a reason why this is an enjoyable experience. One rooted in the most important of sciences. Physics. Take, for example, a bottle of Tobasco Sauce. If one where to move the bottle up and down in a motion reminiscent to the one used during male self-stimulation it typically results in a moderate amount of sauce exiting the bottle. If struck hard on the bottom, however, a large amount will spurt out. Should this be done with the name genitals, turning them upside down and then striking the bottom of the scrotum with moderate to immense force, this will result in a large amount of seed to be ejected from the penis due to the energy being transferred from the palm of the hand to genitals. Therefore, because of physics and the transfer of energy from palm to the genitals, cock and ball torture is a scientifically pleasurable experience.');

My entire body was shaking!!! How dare he offend me like that and spread pure evil into the world? So I walked over to him, and punched him so hard he was doing the wormdance on the ground. And then I shouted "DEOD BAD CRESSELIA GOOD!!!!" and then I trampled him to death while shitting profusely all over his corpse. Now obviously I expected that everyone would applause me for hindering the spread of evil and for doing gods work, but for some weird reason everyone just started screaming, and after a couple of minutes the police arrived and they arrested me?!?!
